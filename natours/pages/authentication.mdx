title: Authentication
---

The Natours API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

## Protecting Routes

Certain routes are protected and require a valid token to be included in the request headers.

### Authorization Header

To authenticate your requests, include the token in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-token-here>
```

## How to obtain a token

1. **Sign Up**: Create a new account via `POST /api/v1/users/signup`.
2. **Login**: Authenticate with your email and password via `POST /api/v1/users/login`.

Upon successful login or signup, the API will return a JWT in the response body (and often as a cookie).

## Roles and Permissions

Some endpoints are restricted to specific user roles (e.g., `admin`, `lead-guide`). Ensure your user account has the necessary permissions to access these routes.
