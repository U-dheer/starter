Natours is a specialized API for a tour booking application. It provides endpoints to manage tours, users, reviews, and bookings.

## Getting Started

To start using the Natours API, you can explore the [API Reference](/api) to see all available endpoints and their requirements.

## Key Features

- **Tours**: Explore and manage various tours with details like difficulty, price, and ratings.
- **Users**: Secure user authentication and profile management.
- **Reviews**: Read and write reviews for different tours.
- **Booking**: (Coming soon) Book your favorite tours directly through the API.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication using a JWT token. You can obtain a token by logging in or signing up via the `/api/v1/users/login` or `/api/v1/users/signup` endpoints.
